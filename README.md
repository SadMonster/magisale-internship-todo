1st Step task: Code is simple as it possible, so you should be able to understand its basics concepts 2-3 days or even faster if you're already familiar with JS and HTML.

2nd: Let's mix a things a little bit! Add a new field called "Title" to app's sources at Todo creator inputs and Todo item view.
"Title" expected to work as previous field called "todo", only one thing I want you to do - is **create a copy of it and make it work**.

3rd: Now as we have a lot of todo's done we need to have a possibility to delete some of them, so as you understand - you should to 
**implement a deleting functionality** to your app

4th: Is it enough, only creating and deleting? No! We need to edit our mistakes here so **add a editing functionality** to this app.

5th: Let's make our app beautifull now! It's dangerous to go alone, take [this](https://material-ui.com/)! Make your app looks like
